# 413_manual_distro
Public repo for koios queries and tx inputs


Here delegates will able to see the koios queries (raw) and datasheet used to manually distribute rewards in Cardano Epoch 413.

This decision was taken to mitigate the poor slot assignment for the epoch, using Operator rewards.

Thank you to our delegates for their patience and continued support.

## NOTES

1) A flat 4% annualised return was applied to all delegates;
2) For delegated addresses which did not meet the minimum UTxO size (0.978370 ADA), the output was rounded up to the minimum.
