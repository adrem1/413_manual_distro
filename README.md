# EPOCH 413 MANUAL REWARD DISTRIBUTION 
*Public repo for koios queries and tx inputs*


Here delegates will able to see the koios queries (raw) and datasheet,
used to manually distribute rewards in Cardano Epoch 413.
This decision was made to mitigate the poor slot assignment 
for the epoch, using Operator rewards.

***Thank you to our delegates for their patience and continued support***.

## NOTES

1) A flat 4% annualised return was applied to all delegates;
2) For delegated addresses which did not meet the minimum UTxO size (0.978370 ADA), the output was rounded up to the minimum.
